# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)

  - Instagram
  - Discord (For screensharing and meetings)

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time?

  - Within 24 hours acknowledge it has been seen (Reaction), or actively respond with feedback.

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)

  - When they don't understand something
  - When they can't meet a deadline

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)
  - A response of understanding or lack of understanding (Nods are fine).
---

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
* Everyone has a list of the things they are expected to do

  - That list doesn't have to be long
  - If there isn't a lot that needs to be done, it's fine to have someone to just do it with discussion
* Honesty

  - What they say aligns with what they do
* Vocal

  - If a person is doing work, and is stuck for more than a day, they should ask for help

---

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
  - Decisions should be made with unanimous acceptance. The first suggestion with unanimous acceptance should be taken, and a new suggestion should be made if changes are wanted.
    - This means that once an agreement is made, changing one's mind means changing other people's minds as well.

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
  - Team conflicts should be resolved in three steps of escalation
    - Conversation with each other
    - Conversation with another two team members (Or one if this includes everyone except one person) (Skip to next step if this is with everyone)
    - Conversation with a TA
---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
  - A lack of understanding should be said
  - Tasks should be finished on time, or reported as undoable as soon as possible
